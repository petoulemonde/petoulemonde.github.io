### Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

In 1847, Dr. Semmelweis instated a policy where doctors had to use a chlorine solution to wash their hands between performing autopsies and seeing patients. The maternal mortality rate drastically decreased as seen in the plot below. In this project, I used the Semmelweiss data to prove that handwashing is a medical necessity.
