## The project

Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.
The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population. Explore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if this is true and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

Language: PostgreSQL

Skills developped: Data manipulation, Case studies
