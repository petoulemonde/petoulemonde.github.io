## The porject

Life expectancy at birth is a measure of the average a living being is expected to live. It takes into account several demographic factors like gender, country, or year of birth.

Life expectancy at birth can vary along time or between countries because of many causes: the evolution of medicine, the degree of development of countries, or the effect of armed conflicts. Life expectancy varies between gender, as well. The data shows that women live longer that men. Why? Several potential factors, including biological reasons and the theory that women tend to be more health conscious.

Let's create some plots to explore the inequalities about life expectancy at birth around the world. We will use a dataset from the United Nations Statistics Division.
